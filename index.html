<h1>Status</h1>
<p>VTLUUG's site is down because it got unmaintainable. We are working on
hosting a static copy of it here on github. The wiki is currently dead. For any
questions, comments, concerns, volunteerism for sysadmining, or offers of free
colocation in the Blacksburg area, you may visit us on #vtluug on irc.oftc.net,
or send mail to our mailing list, vtluug-g@vt.edu. </p>

<p> Gopher is still functional, at gohper://vtluug.org </p>

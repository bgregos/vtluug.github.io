This document describes how to build the infrastructure from scratch, as well manage it in general. 

'SCRIPTS' refers to the scripts repo, found at https://github.com/vtluug/scripts

3. Configuration



Installation
============

All Hosts
- Set static ip and gateway as indicated in SCRIPTS/router/lan/local_hosts, and set the subnet mask to 255.255.0.0

Proxmox Hosts
- Use vtluug+notifications@gmail.com for the email address requested at installation

Non-Proxmox Hosts
- Create an admin user that is *not* the same as your ldap username

More configuration will be done in the 'Configuration' section after Networking



Networking
==========
- Set up physical boxes based on architecture_pic.png TODO
- Determine the ip addresses based on file_from_scripts_repo.txt


Switch
------
- Ensure IGMP multicast querying & snooping are enabled. Test it here: https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Multicast_notes#Using_omping_to_test_multicast
    - This is required for the Proxmox cluster


Router (Debian)
---------------

Configure IP addresses
- Copy SCRIPTS/router/ip-config/interfaces into /etc/network/interfaces

Configure ARP Proxying
- Copy SCRIPTS/router/proxy/arp_proxy.sh into /usr/local/bin/
- Copy SCRIPTS/router/proxy/arp_proxy.service into /etc/systemd/system
- Start and enable arp_proxy.service

Configure dnsmasq (DHCP/DNS) & resolv.conf
- Install dnsmasq
- Copy SCRIPTS/router/lan/dnsmasq.conf into /etc/dnsmasq.conf
- Copy SCRIPTS/router/lan/local_hosts into /usr/local/bin
- Copy SCRIPTS/router/lan/resolv.conf into /etc/resolv.conf
- Start and enable dnsmasq.service

Configure iptables (NAT/Firewall)
- Install iptables
- Copy SCRIPTS/router/lan/vtluug_iptables.sh into /usr/local/bin
- Copy SCRIPTS/router/lan/vtluug_iptables.service into /etc/systemd/system
- Start and enable vtluug_iptables.service



Configuration
=============

Non-Ansible
-----------

Proxmox
- Create an admin user with sudo privileges, *not* using the same username as your ldap username
- Create the cluster following this guide: https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Cluster_Manager
- If you use firefox and a touchscreen you must disable 'dom.w3c_touch_events.enabled' in about:config for the Proxmox web GUI to work on your device
    - Yeah, it's stupid; get over it

**At this point, all bare metal hosts should have an admin user created, so root ssh will be disabled in the following section

Non-Proxmox
- TODO


Ansible
-------

First, clone the repo at https://github.com/vtluug/ansible


All Hosts
- Run 'ansible-playbook main.yml -i hosts.cfg -K -u <admin-user>'

Proxmox
- Ansible configured most of postfix, but auth still needs to be configured
- On each Proxmox host, put 'smtp.gmail.com:587 vtluug.notifications@gmail.com:<password>' in /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
    - The password can be found in the private accounts repo
- Run 'postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd' then 'rm /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd'
- Restart postfix
- Verify email is working properly: 'echo test | mail -s testing you@email.com' and look in /var/log/mail.log for errors

This document describes how to build the infrastructure from scratch, as well manage it in general. 

'SCRIPTS' refers to the scripts repo, found at https://github.com/vtluug/scripts


Networking
==========
- Set up physical boxes based on architecture_pic.png TODO
- Determine the ip addresses based on file_from_scripts_repo.txt


Switch
------
- Ensure IGMP multicast querying & snooping are enabled. Test it here: https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Multicast_notes#Using_omping_to_test_multicast
    - This is required for the Proxmox cluster


Router (Debian)
---------------

Configure IP addresses
- Copy SCRIPTS/router/ip-config/interfaces into /etc/network/interfaces

Configure ARP Proxying
- Copy SCRIPTS/router/proxy/arp_proxy.sh into /usr/local/bin/
- Copy SCRIPTS/router/proxy/arp_proxy.service into /etc/systemd/system
- Start and enable arp_proxy.service

Configure dnsmasq (DHCP/DNS) & resolv.conf

This document describes how to build the infrastructure from scratch, as well manage it in general. 

'SCRIPTS' refers to the scripts repo, found at https://github.com/vtluug/scripts
'ANSIBLE' refers to the ansible repo, found at https://github.com/vtluug/ansible

For ansible:
- Install it
- Install any additional packages in the ansible readmeg

3. Configuration



Installation
============

All Hosts
- Set static ip and gateway as indicated in SCRIPTS/router/lan/local_hosts, and set the subnet mask to 255.255.0.0

Proxmox Hosts
- Use vtluug+notifications@gmail.com for the email address requested at installation

Non-Proxmox Hosts
- Create the papatux user with the password in the vtluug-admin repo
    - This is used as a general admin account

If any hosts are installed without internet connection, make sure you install & enable ssh, and install python once internet works.

More configuration will be done in the 'Configuration' section after Networking



Networking
==========
- Set up physical boxes based on architecture_pic.png TODO
- Determine the ip addresses based on file_from_scripts_repo.txt


Switch
------
- Ensure IGMP multicast querying & snooping are enabled. Test it here: https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Multicast_notes#Using_omping_to_test_multicast
    - This is required for the Proxmox cluster


Router (Debian)
---------------

Configure IP addresses
- Copy SCRIPTS/router/ip-config/interfaces into /etc/network/interfaces

Configure ARP Proxying
- Copy SCRIPTS/router/proxy/arp_proxy.sh into /usr/local/bin/
- Copy SCRIPTS/router/proxy/arp_proxy.service into /etc/systemd/system
- Start and enable arp_proxy.service

Configure dnsmasq (DHCP/DNS) & resolv.conf
- Install dnsmasq
- Copy SCRIPTS/router/lan/dnsmasq.conf into /etc/dnsmasq.conf
- Copy SCRIPTS/router/lan/local_hosts into /usr/local/bin
- Copy SCRIPTS/router/lan/resolv.conf into /etc/resolv.conf
- Start and enable dnsmasq.service

Configure iptables (NAT/Firewall)
- Install iptables
- Copy SCRIPTS/router/lan/vtluug_iptables.sh into /usr/local/bin
- Copy SCRIPTS/router/lan/vtluug_iptables.service into /etc/systemd/system
- Start and enable vtluug_iptables.service



Configuration
=============
These steps MUST be done in order. YMMV otherwise.

Proxmox Hosts
- Create the papatux user with sudo privileges, *not* using the same username as your ldap username
- Create the cluster following this guide: https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Cluster_Manager
- If you use firefox and a touchscreen you must disable 'dom.w3c_touch_events.enabled' in about:config for the Proxmox web GUI to work on your device
    - Yeah, it's stupid; get over it

**At this point, all bare metal hosts should have an admin user created, so root ssh will be disabled in the following step


Baremetal Hosts
- Make sure you've copied your ssh key to all the baremetal servers so ansible works
- Run 'ansible-playbook main.yml -i hosts.cfg -K -u papatux --limit=baremetal'
    - Configures most things and sets NFS exports, but the ZFS pools still need to be made a few other things need to be done manually as well

NFS
- Dirtycow - 8 2TB drives in a raidz3 pool named 'cistern'
    - Similarly, run 'zpool create -f -o ashift=12 keg raidz2 <disk_1_id> <disk_2_id> ... <disk_8_id>
    - Create the following directories by running 'zfs create <directory>':
        - cistern/nfs
        - cistern/nfs/pve
        - cistern/nfs/pve/images
        - cistern/nfs/pve/isos
        - cistern/nfs/pve/templates
        - cistern/nfs/home
        - cistern/nfs/scratch

- Cyberdelia - 7 1TB drives in a raidz3 zfs pool named 'tank'
    - Similarly, run 'zpool create -f -o ashift=12 keg raidz2 <disk_1_id> <disk_2_id> ... <disk_7_id>
    - Create the following directories by running 'zfs create <directory>':
        - tank/nfs
        - tank/nfs/backup
        - tank/nfs/scratch

- Shellshock - 3 500GB drives in a raidz2 zfs pool named 'keg'
    - To build the zfs pool, first look up the device ids in /dev/disk/by-id since these are guaranteed to not change (unlike /dev/sdX)
    - Run 'zpool create -f -o ashift=12 keg raidz1 <disk_1_id> <disk_2_id> <disk_3_id>
    - Create the following directories by running 'zfs create <directory>':
        - keg/nfs
        - keg/nfs/backup
        - keg/nfs/scratch

Creating the VM templates
- We need to manually install a VM first, then we'll make that into a few templates to build everything else on
- Don't worry, this is the only part involving touching the GUI :P
- Download the latest ubuntu iso to dirtycow.private.vtluug.org:/cistern/nfs/pve/isos/template/iso/
    - I recommend not using the net-installer for ubuntu if installing via VNC on proxmox
    - Go to https://10.98.0.3:8006, and log in as root
    - Creating the base template
        - Click 'Create VM' in the top right corner
        - Check the 'Advanced' checkbox in the bottom right corner
        - In the 'General' tab, put 'ubuntu-tiny' in the 'Name' field and check the 'Start at boot' checkbox
        - In the 'OS' tab, select 'dirtycow_isos' in the 'Storage' field and the latest ubuntu LTS (SERVER edition) you just downloaded in the 'ISO image' field
        - In the 'Hard Disk' tab, select 'dirtycow_images' is selected in the 'Storage' field and put '10' in the 'Disk size (GiB)' field
        - In the 'CPU' tab, select '1' in the 'Cores' field
        - In the 'Memory' tab, put '1024' in the 'Memory (MiB)' field
        - In the 'Network' tab, do nothing
        - In the 'Confirm' tab, make sure everything is correct
        - Finally, click 'Finish'
        - Once installation is finished we'll convert this into a template and make the 'ubuntu-small' and 'ubuntu-medium' templates then create the actual VMs from those
    - Installing the base template
        - In the top right corner, select 'Start'
        - From the left inner sidebar, select 'Console' to see a VNC session of the VM
        - Use the default options until you get to the 'Hostname' prompt, and use 'template' (Note: *not* {ubuntu,centos}-tiny)
        - Use 'papatux' for the name and username, and the password from the vtluug-admin repo for the password
        - Use 'Guided - use entire disk' for partitioning
        - Use the defaults then wait awhile...
        - Select 'Install security updates automatically'
        - At the 'Software Selection' screen, select 'OpenSSH server'
        - Use the defaults then wait while it finishes installing
        - Reboot into the system, install sudo if not already installed, and make sure papatux is in the sudo/wheel group (depending on distro)
        - Run 'sudo apt install python' bc ansible requires python2
        - Also run 'sudo rm /etc/machin-id' and edit /etc/crontab:
            - Add '@reboot root test -x /etc/machine-id || systemd-machine-id
            - This creates unique uuids for VMs; otherwise they'd all be the same
        - Select 'Shutdown' in the top right corner
        - Still on the 'Hardware' tab, right click on 'CD/DVD Drive' and select 'Do not use any media'
        - In case you're wondering, MACs are automatically changed during a clone
    - Creating the templates
        - Here, we're taking the VM just created, converting it to a template, then cloning it to make 2 more templates
        - From the left outer sidebar, select Datacenter > meltdown > 100 (ubuntu-tiny)
        - Select More > Convert to template
        - Select More > Clone
        - Put 'ubuntu-small' in the 'Name' field
        - Select 'Full Clone' in the 'Mode' field then click 'Clone'
        - From the left outer sidebar, select Datacenter > meltdown > 101 (ubuntu-small)
        - Select 'Hardware' in the left inner sidebar
        - Double click 'Memory' and change it to '2048'
        - Double click 'Processors' and change it to '2'
        - Cilck More > Convert to template from the top right corner
        - Repeat these steps, except name the template 'ubuntu-medium', use 4 cores, and 4096 Memory
    - Repeat the above steps using the latest Centos MINIMAL image, except only create the 'centos-tiny' template
        - Note: Don't forget to set the hostname to 'template' during installation since it's less obvious
        - This will (only) be used for the freeipa server, because fuck freeipa
    - Finally, you should have a tiny, small, and medium ubuntu template, and a centos tiny template
        - Where tiny = 1 core, 1GB ram, small = 2 core, 2GB ram, and medium = 4 core, 4GB ram


Creating the VMs
- Set the PROXMOX_PASSWORD environment variable to the root proxmox password
- Run 'ansible-playbook deploy.yml -i hosts.cfg -K -u papatux -k'
    - -K and --ask-pass are used because newly deployed vms don't have ssh keys or passwordless sudo yet
    - This will result in some hosts showing "unreachable" because the new VMs are rebooted after hostname & ip changes
- If some hosts are *not* successfully created, remove those V

Configuring the new VMs
- Run 'ansible-playbook main.yml -i hosts.cfg -K -u papatux -k --limit=vms'
    - This mostly configures all the new vms

- Installing FreeIPA Server
    - ssh into chimera, then run 'ipa-server-install' and set the following options:
    - Do you want to configure integrated DNS (BIND)? [no]: yes
    - Server host name: chimera.private.vtluug.org
    - Domain name: krb.vtluug.org
    - Realm name: KRB.VTLUUG.ORG
    - Directory Manager PW: see accounts file in gitolite-admin
    - admin PW: See accounts file in gitolite-admin
    - Configure DNS forwarders: yes
    - Search for missing reverse zones: yes
    - Continue to configure system with these values: yes
    - Test it by running 'kinit admin'
